# What is strategy pattern?

For when we want to define a class that will have one behaviour that is similar to other behaviors in a list 

#### Example
I want the class object to be able to choose from 
1. Not flying
2. Flying with wings
3. Flying with a jetpack
4. etc ...

Strategy pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from its users. The point is that by deferring the decision about which algorithm to use until runtime, it allows us to keep shit flexible which is a good thing when change is guaranteed, as it often is in the world of software.
